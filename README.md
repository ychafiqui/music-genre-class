# Music Genre Classification
## About the project
Audio processing is one of the most complex tasks in data science as compared to image processing and other classification techniques. One such application is Music Genre Classification which aims to classify audio files in certain categories of music to which they belong.

The aim of the project is to avoid having to manually classify music into categories. To automate the process we use Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms and this is what we implemented in this project.

## The web app
In the end, we created a Web-app to automatically classify music by genre using the created models .
